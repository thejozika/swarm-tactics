# swarm-tactics

A game where you can program 2 swarms to fight and learn.
you programm your control units in the files red_team.py and blue_team.py.
In the environment file you can set some environment-Variables.

To run the game just open a console at the location and install numpy [if not already installed] <br>
with `pip install numpy`. <br>
Then you can just run `python main.py` <br>
After that you can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`, <br>
then you will see the game. (after completion of main.py)

you are able step through or just run it automatically.

I suggest starting with Tutorial 2,there you can see the Sensor input that you will get for your brains to programm.
